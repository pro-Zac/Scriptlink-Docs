# A note on the DLL

Many Scriptlink examples will use the `NTST.ScriptLinkService.Objects.dll` in place of the .cs class libraries to instantiate the OptionObject2015 and all subsequent objects. Using the dll is optional, and supplants the need for the object class libs. This expedites ScriptLink coding and completion, however understanding the structure and fuction of the object libraries is essential to understanding the capabilities of ScriptLink, what it can do, how you need to call these functionalities, and very importantly, what myAvatar expects to see returned by the script.

- Personally, I encourage developers to begin using and referencing the class libraries in your script to understand how the ScriptLink framework gets information from myAvatar, to the SOAP api for modification, and back to myAvatar in the form/assessment you are using.
